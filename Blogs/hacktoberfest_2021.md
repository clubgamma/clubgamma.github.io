# Hacktoberfest 2021
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub, Intel, Appwrite & Deepsource.

Club Gamma is the community which aims to work together and grow together. We are going to celebrate the Hacktoberfest this year with a great enthusiasm.
We will put projects on different fields like Mobile App Development, Web Development, Python, etc. We will initialise some GitHub Repo and will make them open source. Anyone can contribute to any of those projects during Hacktoberfest and avail the cool prizes by DigitalOcean, GitHub, Twilio and Club Gamma also.

## What you will get after contributing?
